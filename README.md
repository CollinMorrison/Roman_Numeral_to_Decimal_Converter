# Roman_Numeral_to_Decimal_Converter

Hello!

This Roman Numeral / Decimal converter was coded by Collin Morrison on 3/27/22 starting at 3:05PM and ending at 5:13PM. I included the notes I made prior to actually coding the challenge to help me outline my thoughts. I added to and edited this document as I worked, in order to have a working outline and keep my thoughts organized. It is titled "Decimal to Roman Numeral Converter Plan.txt".
